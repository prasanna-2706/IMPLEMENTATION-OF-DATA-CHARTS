Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing student performance data using different data charts in R. The objective is to understand academic performance patterns through graphical representation.

Dataset Used
Student Performance Dataset

The dataset includes subject details, Internal Test 1 marks, Internal Test 2 marks, assignment marks, and final grades.

Tools and Libraries Used
R Programming Language
RStudio
ggplot2
dplyr

Charts Implemented

Box plot
A box plot  is used to represent subject-wise average marks calculated from the total marks obtained by students.

heat map
A heat map shows the performance trend across Internal Test 1, Internal Test 2, and assignment marks.

histogram
A histogram illustrates the distribution of final grades among students.

Learning Outcomes
Understanding of student performance analysis using data visualization
Ability to calculate total and average marks
Hands-on experience with ggplot2 charts
Improved interpretation of academic data

Conclusion
The student performance analysis using data charts helps in identifying subject-wise strengths, performance trends across different evaluations, and grade distribution. Data visualization makes academic performance data easier to understand and analyze.
